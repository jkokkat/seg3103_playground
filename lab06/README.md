### Part 1: Prequisites
Before I started the lab, I installed maven successfully as shown in the image below when using the command mvn --version. 


### Part 2: Initial Compilations and Testing
After extracting the zip file for BookstoreApp, I ran mvn compile as shown in the image below. 


I then ran mvn package -DskipTests which compiled all the tests without running them. 

Next, I ran java -jar ./target/BookstoreApp-0.1.0.jar.
THhe terminal when running this command is shown below.


The appliation running is shown in the following image.

I ran the initial three tests as seen in the following screenshot here.
